 Hello, I'm Shweta. I have been coding for almost a decade and currently working as a Cloud Consultant at Rapid Circle, India. I love building solutions. I started off as a web developer and have been working extensively with Azure for last 4 years. *Currently, I have been working on building a low-code solution around Azure Governance and automation.*

 I often deal with Imposter syndrome, which has caused me to postpone creating a serious blog until now. *Taking a leap and hoping to create good content around Azure, cloud, automation and more.*

 I am a mom of supremely talkative 3 year old and I thoroughly enjoy what I do. In my spare time, I like watching super dramatic TV shows/movies.

*Thank You for reading!*
